### Hi there! I'm James.

Currently, I’m getting my Ph.D. in Industrial-Organizational Psychology. If you don’t know what that is, see [here](https://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/specialize/industrial). I’m specializing in assessment and selection within pre-employment contexts, understanding and reducing employee turnover, and minimizing adverse impact. At its core, I’m hoping my work will help increase the signal-to-noise ratio (especially at the margins) through the use of psychometrics, feature generation/transformation, and modeling advances. The way I see it, this will reduce the number of false negatives. False negatives are a problem not often talked about in my field relative to false positives. I’m not sure why that is, but decreasing false negatives is at the center of almost everything I do; thus, I’m biased. My no-frills hypothesis here is that lower rates of false negatives (occasionally at the expense of higher rates of false positives) plus extreme iteration equals massive societal, cultural, and economic growth. So, my overall goal is to utilize the skillset and knowledge base I amass during my Ph.D. by getting über-high-talent individuals where they need to be to do their best work. These über-high-talent individuals are the types of people that have frequently been selected out of the running for various reasons and are thus categorized as false negatives.

Individuals in what fields?
- Math
- Physics
- Aerospace Engineering
- Cryobiology
- Interdisciplinary Biology (e.g., Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Bioinformatics, Genetics)

Why?

At this point, I don’t think it’s surprising that the world is safer if you look at the descriptive stats. If that statement catches you by surprise, watch less news, delete your social media, and go outside. The problem with descriptive stats is that they can create a sense of false security if they look good and a sense of impending doom if they look bad. Anyone that has ever touched the world of finance knows that the past does not necessarily help you when attempting to predict the future (although the past certainly has its uses). In fact, it can occasionally make you go bust. Ergodicity is a real thing, people! Unfortunately, if we go bust on a societal-wide level, the ramifications are far more threatening than losing a bunch of money. See [Bostrom (2013)](https://existential-risk.org/concept.pdf) for more details on that. The takeaway is we need to diversify at the highest level. We need to get humanity off of Earth. I think the fields listed earlier are our best bets to make that happen.

On a more optimistic note (I swear I’m not actually that pessimistic), here’s a little more about me as a person!

- 🥘 I’m a foodie. 
- ♾️ I like math/statistics, 📖 reading, 🎸 guitar, ♟️ chess, 🤼‍♂️ grappling/MMA.
- I also enjoy 🎥 movies/TV shows that make me forget about my phone (if you reach for your phone while watching, then stop watching).
